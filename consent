<p><strong>You are being asked to be a volunteer in a research study.</strong>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study is to understand how people make decisions about rewards of money, and how these decisions relate to real-life outcomes such as health. Results will increase our understanding of the mental processes that make reward-related decisions possible.

<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>If you decide to be in this study, you will make decisions about hypothetical situations involving money. You will also be asked questions about your personal habits and finances. There may be multiple conditions to which you may be assigned. If so, you will be assigned to your condition randomly (by chance).

<h2>Risks, costs, and benefits</h2>
<p>I foresee no risks, costs, or benefits to you that may arise from your participation in this study.

<h2>Compensation</h2>
<p>There is a reward of money assigned to the Human Intelligence Task (HIT) you have accepted. You will receive this reward after completing the HIT provided that, in my opinion, you answered my questions thoughtfully, honestly, and manually (that is to say, without having a computer program complete the task for you), and you did not attempt the experiment more than once.

<h2>Confidentiality (protecting your privacy in this study)</h2>
<p>I will never ask for personally identifying information. Your Worker ID and IP address will not be included in any public releases of the study data.

<h2>Your rights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Your participation in this study is voluntary: you don't have to be in this study if you don't want to be.
<li>You have the right to change your mind and leave the study (by selecting "Return HIT") at any time without giving any reason.
<li>Any new information that may make you change your mind about being in this study will be given to you.
<li>You will not lose any of your legal rights by giving your consent.
</ul>

<h2>Questions about the study or your rights</h2>
<p>If you have any questions, concerns, or complaints about the study, you may contact me, Kodi Arfer, by email at <code>arfer.net</code> as the user <code>kodi</code>.
