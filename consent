<p><strong>You are being asked to be a volunteer in a research study.</strong>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study is to understand how people make decisions about rewards of money. Results will increase our understanding of the mental processes that make reward-related decisions possible. You will be one of about 100 participants.

<h2>Procedures</h2>
<p>If you decide to be in this study, you will read descriptions of pairs of rewards that vary in several ways, such as the amount of money offered or your chances of receiving the reward. You will then decide which of the two options you would prefer. There may be multiple conditions to which you may be assigned. If so, you will be assigned to your condition randomly (by chance).

<h2>Risks / Discomforts</h2>
<p>There are no foreseeable risks or discomforts associated with your participation in this study.

<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>There is no benefit expected as a result of your being in this study.

<h2>Compensation</h2>
<p>There is a reward of money assigned to the Human Intelligence Task (HIT) you have accepted. You will receive this reward after completing the HIT provided that, in our opinion, you answered our questions thoughtfully, honestly, and manually (that is to say, without having a computer program complete the task for you), and you did not attempt the experiment more than once.

<h2>Confidentiality (Protecting Your Privacy in this Study)</h2>
<p>We will never ask for personally identifying information. Your Worker ID and IP address will not be included in any public releases of the study data.

<h2>Costs to You</h2>
<p>There are no foreseeable costs for you as a subject in this study.

<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<p>Your alternative to being in this study is to simply not participate.

<h2>Your Rights as a Research Subject</h2>
<ul>
<li>Your participation in this study is voluntary. You do not have to be in this study if you don't want to be.
<li>You have the right to change your mind and leave the study (by selecting "Return HIT") at any time without giving any reason.
<li>Any new information that may make you change your mind about being in this study will be given to you.
<li>You do not lose any of your legal rights by giving your consent.
</ul>
