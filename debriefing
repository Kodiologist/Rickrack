<h1>Debriefing</h1>

<p>We are interested in how people make choices. Previous studies have found that most of the time, people like to get things of value (like money) sooner rather than later. People are said to "discount" future rewards. This study is intended to explore the details of discounting.

<h2>How did the task work?</h2>
<p>In this study, you performed a decision-making task: you chose between two options, each of which offered an amount of money. Most of the time, one of these two options represented a smaller but immediate payout whereas the other represented a larger payout that had to be waited for. We carefully manipulated how the value of each option was related to how delayed that option was. By determining which choices you prefer to wait for, we can compute how valuable each option was for you and how those values determined your choices.

<h2>What do you expect?</h2>
<p>We expect to find that people have predictable preferences in these tasks. For example, as mentioned above, delayed rewards should be seen as less valuable than immediate rewards. We also expect to find that people are more patient about a pair of rewards that are both delayed (like $100 in 60 days vs. $150 in 90 days) than the same pair of rewards available sooner (like $100 today vs. $150 in 30 days). By examining how these factors influence choices, we should be able to estimate each person's discounting function, a mathematical object that precisely describes how people's preferences for rewards change over time.

<h2>Why did you use the same task twice?</h2>
<p>We are specifically interested in the test-retest reliability of our task. That is, we want to know how well the discounting function we assign to a person based on their choices at one time matches the discounting function we assign based on the same person's choices at a later time. We want to demonstrate a close match in order to argue that our task provides a usefully precise estimate of the discounting function.

<h2>Why is this important to study?</h2>
<p>The ability to wait for delayed rewards has been linked to all sorts of other behavior. Children, drug addicts, and people with ADHD all have abnormalities in their ability to wait for rewards. In the case of drug addiction, this ability may relate to cases in which addicts choose the short-term pleasure of using a drug over long-term rewards such as their job success and their health.
